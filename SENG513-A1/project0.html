            <h1>The &ltJoe&gt Button</h1>
            <p>
                In this project, I will design, implement and
                document via this web portfolio a software application where 
                central interaction is with a button, which represents some 
                aspect of my client's personality or character.

            <h2>The Interview Phase</h2>
            <p>
                I have interviewed my classmate Jacky. Some facts of him are listed in below.
            </p>
            <table>
                <ol>
                    <li>He wears glasses.</li>
                    <li>He plays video games.</li>
                    <li>He loves palying Overwatch.</li>
                    <li>He palys acoustic guitar.</li>
                    <li>He is a night owl.</li>
                    <li>He likes listening to music.</li>
                    <li>He is a computer science student.</li>
                    <li>He is taking the HCI course.</li>
                </ol>
            </table>
            <p>
                When I started sketching, I realized that I should have asked more questions
                to complete the details. As my group is going to use a celebrity as our client,
                I listed in below some questions that I found helpful to define a person's traits
                for the design of the button.
            </p>
            <table>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your favorite color?</li>
                    <li>What is your favorite video game?</li>
                    <li>What is your favorite song?</li>
                    <li>At what time of the day do you usually play games/the guitar?</li>
                    <li>With whom do you paly games with?</li>
                    <li>And so on ...</li>
                </ul>
            </table>
