            <h1>The &ltJoe&gt Button</h1>
            <p>
                In this project, I will design, implement and
                document via this web portfolio a software application where 
                central interaction is with a button, which represents some 
                aspects of my client's personality or character. <br>
                As a group of five, we initially decided to interview our classmates separately, and then
                collect our ideas and use a celebrity as our client. After finishing ten sketches, comparing
                and discussing, we decided to create a button that represents our classmate Robert.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Interview Phase</h2>
            <p>
                I have interviewed my classmate Jacky. Some facts of him are listed in below.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>He wears glasses.</li>
                <li>He plays video games.</li>
                <li>He loves palying Overwatch.</li>
                <li>He palys acoustic guitar.</li>
                <li>He is a night owl.</li>
                <li>He likes listening to music.</li>
                <li>He is a computer science student.</li>
                <li>He is taking the HCI course.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                When I started sketching, I realized that I should have asked more questions
                to complete the details. As my group is going to use a celebrity as our client,
                I listed in below some questions that I found helpful to define a person's traits
                for the design of the button.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is your favorite color?</li>
                <li>What is your favorite video game?</li>
                <li>What is your favorite song?</li>
                <li>At what time of the day do you usually play games/the guitar?</li>
                <li>With whom do you paly games with?</li>
                <li>And so on ...</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Sketches</h2>

                Here are some of my original designs. <br><br>

            <h2>Refinement Sketches</h2>
            <p>
                After gathering all of our ideas, we decided to use Robert, one of our classmates 
                who loves weightlifting, as our client. We had several ideation iterations to 
                finalize our 10 refinement sketches.

                        <td>Refinement sketch 1&2, from Jason. Power meter window and cheesecake as the reward. We chose
                            to use green and blue as our color theme because these are Robert's favorate colors. And 
                            Robert also likes cheesecakes.

                        <td>Refinement sketch 3, from Jason. There is a progress bar surrounding the app. Every time
                            we press the button, Robert pushes the lifter and the progress bar would change color.

                            we use it as our background music. He likes Apple and cheesecake, so we consider to use eatable
                            apple and cheesecake as periodic motivation.
